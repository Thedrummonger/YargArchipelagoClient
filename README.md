# TDM-GO!

A custom Archipela-GO! client that lets you manually define check locations instead of using pre-existing points of interest.

## How it works

While not connected to an archipelago room, long-press the map to add markers where you want checks to appear. Once the seed is generated, it will assign the generated locations based on those predefined selections.

While most Archipela-GO! features are supported, things like progressive distance reduction and the minimum and maximum distance are never utilized, since distance is something you define in the app when setting your valid locations.

## Marker Colors

- **Orange**: Setup locations (before connecting)
- **Green**: Can be checked
- **Red**: Need more keys
- **Blue**: Hinted and unlocked
- **Purple**: Hinted but locked
